Link: https://chen-han-np.github.io/ID_S10202961_Chen-Han_Assg1_website/

This website is designed to present myself with every neccessary informations to get hired by potential recruiters.

Design Process
- I want to make this website a unique page to sell myself to all the potential recruiters to hire me. 
The website will contain multiple sections which are:
1. Home page (with contacts)
2. About page
3. Education & Experience page
4. Skills page
5. Participations & Achievements page
6. Leadership Roles page 
7. Projects page 
8. Testimonials page

There are also fun features added to be more visually appealing to the viewer. 
Such as an image slider is designed in Participations & Achievements page to 
store all the images and display them to the viewer one by one automatically.

Another feature is introduced in the skills page, that all the skills are presented
using a progress bar. This idea of using a progress bar to represent skill level is 
inspired by my friend - Yan Jie, who gave me the permission to use his idea for my portfolio designing.

There are also links to my personal Social Media pages such as Instagram and LinkedIn account in the
home page.

More details can be found in the wireframe file attached.
